# Ternary and Binary Adder Implementation

This project implements a binary and ternary adder using custom logic systems. The ternary adder supports uncertainty propagation, where `0` represents an unknown state (`U`).

## Features
- **Binary Adder**: Supports standard binary addition (0, 1).
- **Ternary Adder**: Supports ternary addition (-1, 0, 1) with uncertainty propagation.
